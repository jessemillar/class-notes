### Definitions
- `Dirty Shutdown` Ripping out a power cord
- `Clean Shutdown` Shutting down via the proper method

### General Notes
A hash is one-way  
Encryption can be undone

File hashes are collision resistant  
It's statistically unlikely that two different files will have the same hash

Don't use MD5 for hashing (too easy to create collisions)  
Current best-practice standards for hashing is to use SHA256

Take at least two hashes for each file

We mostly look at registers in embedded systems (and largely ignore them in PC situations)

Performing a dirty shutdown and then imaging the hard drive can sometimes result in a copy of useful SWAP memory

Don't work more than one lab ahead of where we are in the class  
There's a risk that labs will change and all your work will be for nothing

### Steps for Analyzing Volatile Data
1. Start by taking the system date and time
1. Network connections
1. Open ports
1. Executables attached to ports
1. NetBIOS/DNS/ARTP caches
1. Users logged on
1. Routing table
1. Running processes
1. Running services
1. Scheduled jobs
1. Open files
1. Process memory dumps
1. Power off
1. Take the hard drive

> Dumping process memory has a high chance of crashing the system which is why we save it for last.

### Memory Dumps in Order
1. Physical memory
1. Swap memory
1. Process memory
