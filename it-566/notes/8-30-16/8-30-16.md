### General Notes
- Two class sections will be largely kept in sync so we should be able to bounce between as needed
- Strict attendance policy (email your section teacher if you go to the other section on a certain day)
- Learning Suite is not up yet
- Make sure you buy a portable, self-powered hard drive and bring it to class (we're going to be downloading disk images and such so probably shoot for a TB)
- Labs won't be "scripted," they will be largely presented in a style of "here's a problem go find a solution"
- No quizzes instead of the final
- Open-book final
