### Terminology
- `Victim Host` The machine involved in whatever happened (there is no such thing as a malicious machine)
- `Analysis Station` The host performing analysis

### General Notes
- A common question involved in data forensics is when to "pull the plug"  
- You want to be able to have a good idea of what was going on on a computer without interfering with what was happening  
- Do you pull the plug if a program is wiping a drive you need? (the professor said he would)
- A lot (if not most) of enterprise companies have legal contracts in place allowing them to peruse any and all network traffic
- Decrypting network traffic is much easier if the traffic originates from a company-controlled machine  
  - In that situation, you can get the encryption keys off the originating computer and simply decrypt the network traffic
- There are a few main objectives regarding responding to and acting on forensics situations:  
  - Restore
  - Persevere
  - Prosecute
  - Research
- In a prosecution setting, we would (ideally) freeze time and take a complete clone of the  system in question
- There's no solid way of freezing a system (although dipping RAM sticks into liquid nitrogen can cause the sticks to retain memory for five to ten minutes)
- Forensics notebooks used to keep track of what you did, when, and in what order are absolutely paramount
- There are varying degrees of memory volatility
- Holding down the left shift key when putting in a drive disables all autorun
- Do **NOT** copy tools onto a computer you're analyzing (it overwrites deleted files) 

### Preferred Forensics Devices
1. CDRom
1. Floppy disk
1. Memory card (built in reader)
1. Network drive
1. USB key

If you find evidence that a suspect used a specific type of drive, use the same type to avoid extra drivers being installed on drive insert

### Employee Suspected of Corporate Espionage
> Discuss what evidence would be useful for investigating this sort of attack

- Method of stealing data
- What data was taken
  - Illicit access to data stores (accessing a database they don't have permissions for)
- Method of sharing data
- What data was shared
- Check key card codes to check if a person was in a building at a specific time (make sure the person at "fault" was actually the person behind the computer")
