### Ohm's Law
Give all 3 forms of the Ohmâ€™s Law equation.
```
I = E/R
```

### Power Formula
Give 3 forms of the power equation.
```
P = IE
```

### Ohm/Power Combinations
```
P=(I^2)R  
P=(E^2)/R
```

### Resistor Calculations
```
Series
All elements have the same I
RT=R1+R2+...
```
```
Parallel
All elements have the same I
RT=1/(1/R1+1/R2+...)
```
