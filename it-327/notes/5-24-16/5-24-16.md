### Definitions
- `Parity` used to check for bit errors in metadata
- `Baud rate` is the maximum number of transitions in the data per unit time (per second)
- `PRBS` is Psudo-Random Bit Sequence

### General Content
Errors are always "bursty"  
Errors generally happen in bursts of noise

CRC and Checksums are pretty much the same thing

Interleaving data assists with counteracting bursting errors

Biggest difference between analog and digital modulation is the number of levels you're allows to modulate to (analog is infinite while digital is discrete)

`Q` stands for "quadrature" which means "shifted by 90 degrees"

PRBS do not allow `0000 0000` to be generated

Data is communicated via dv/dt  
Like scanning a line of pixels in a camera and generating a voltage level based on the scanned value

### Types of Error Checking and Correction
1. Parity
1. CRC and Checksums
1. ECC (Error Correction Coding) and/or FEC (Forward Error Correction)

### Exclusive OR Gate
Truth table:  

|A|B|Y|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|

Changing the `A` input decides whether or not to flip the `B` input

### ECC/FEC
Looks for mistakes in the data bit by bit, finds errors, and inverts the bit (fixing it)

Calculates parity for rows and columns and then compares to parity for the parity

Adds 12.8% overhead but increases error correction capability by **18 orders of magnitude**
