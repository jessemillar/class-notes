### Upcoming Quiz

### Definitions
- `Precision` keeps track of variation in percentage between measurements
- `Accuracy`
- `Resolution`
- `Impedence` is basically resistance for now
- `Meter Loading Effect` is the impact using a volt meter has on measuring the current of a circuit

### General Content
Lecture about electronic measuring equipment

Anytime we measure something, we disturb what we're measuring and achieve less-than-perfect measurments (per quantum principles)  
There is no such thing as a perfect measurement

You can't have a good meter unless it's both precise and accurate

"Pixel" stands for "picture element"

There's no such thing as no resistance

Voltmeters have something inside them called a internal resistor impedence  
You can accidentally short circuit a circuit with a volt meter if the meter has less impedence than the resistor it's measuring does (EG: a 10 MΩ voltmeter on a 100MΩ resistor)  
Volt meters measure with reference to 0 (meaning the black, ground contact)

The reference in a non-grounded car is the biggest piece of metal (the chassis)  
The reference point does NOT have to be the literal ground

### Precision
Precision is measured as a percentage  
0% precision means perfect (implying low values are good)

### Accuracy
Accuracy is also measured in percent  
Lower percentages indicate higher accuracy

These shots average to all bullseyes

### Resolution
Measured in digits, %, ppm (parts per million)  High value in digits = good  Low value in % or ppm = good

![Multimeter](multimeter.png)  
This multimeter shows 4 digits which is a possible range of 10,000 numbers  
```
(1/10000)/(1/100) = 0.01% = 100 ppm
```  
Calculating resolution depends on the relationship between `1/100`
