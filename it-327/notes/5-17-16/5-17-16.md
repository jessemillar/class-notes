### Definitions
- `Quantization error` is a fancy word for "step size"

### General Content
There are only two ways to have a cable with no impedence:  

- Infinite cable length
- Make Zo, Zout, and Zin the same

Zo of coax cable used in lab to connect function generators to circuits is about 50 Î©

If length of the cable is >= 0.1 lamda, imdedence cable law comes into play

```
speed of light/1 kHz = 300 km

0.1 lamda = 30 m
```

Resistance is not a function of frequency

Most antenna are the size of a quarter wavelength

### Line Losses
In order of greatest to least:

1. I^2R heating
1. Skin effect losses
1. Capacitively coupled to ground
1. Radiation losses
1. Imperfection in materials
1. Dialectric heating

Capacitance is the biggest culprit in regards to slow data rates

### Test Questions
What are the reasons we can't send data from A to B on a piece of wire at whatever rate we want?

- Transmission line effects
- Frequency rate effects
