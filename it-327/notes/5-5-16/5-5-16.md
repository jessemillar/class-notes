### Definitions
- `POTS` means "plain ol' telephone service"

### General Content
You can't have a good communication system without filters to extract your message from all the noise

Shannon's Law is super important (memorize it)

```
log(base 2)(x)=log(base 10)(x)/log(base 10)(2)
```

Bandwidth describes how long a "highway" is  
Capacity is the number of cars you can cram on the road (how much space there is between them)

You can't define the period of a wave that doesn't repeat

A sine wave has ONE spectral component

Spectrum analyzers show time in reverse

`High frequencies = Lots of spectrum`

### Shannon's Law
```
Capacity(bits/sec) = BW * log(base 2)(1+signal/noise)
```

`signal/noise` is always unitless in Shannon's Law
