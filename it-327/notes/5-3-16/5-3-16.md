### Definitions
- `Current` movement of electrons
- `Reactance` another form of opposition
- `Permability` is the degree to which a material loves a magnetic field
- `Self-inductance` is always the same as `inductance`

### General Content
Don't use DC offset on the function generators in the lab (we just won't need it for this class)

To check current direction, use the right-hand rule (where thumb points in direction of current)

Coiling wire (in an inductance situation) results in a larger magnetic field

DC has a frequency of `0`

Even straight wire has inductance, coils just concentrate it

Think of self-inductance as inertia  
Opposes ∆I

```
L = (μo * μr * N^2 * A)/l

μo = 1.256e-6 H/m
μr = 1.0000003 (air) to 1000000 (metglas)
```

### Analysis of RL Circuits

Same as with DC circuits but using complex numbers

```
L = 100 μH
f = 1 MHz
R = 1kΩ
```

### Test Questions
```
What is it about inductance that opposes changes in I?

Inductance is the property of the magnetic field associated with current
It's the magnetic field that opposes changes
```

```
Is it possible to have voltage without current?

Yes
```

```
Why do inductors (L) not oppose I?

XL = 2(pi)fL

f = Frequency
```
