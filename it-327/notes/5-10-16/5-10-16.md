### Definitions
- `software-defined radio`
- `isotropic` means omnidirectional
- `sideband` a result of modulation
- `harmonic` an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency
- `SSB` single sideband or suppressed sideband
- `noise succeptibility` means that noise makes a signal worse than it would otherwise

### General Content

```
Power
dB = 10log(P out(P2)/P in(P1))

Voltage
dB = 20log(V measured(V2)/V expected(V1))
```

The upper and lower sideband are always equal in amplitude  
This isn't necessarily a good thing because it results in duplicate information

`fc` = frequency of carrier (sine wave)
`fs` = frequency of signal (the information) (sine wave)

AM is power inefficient but spectral efficient  
FM is power efficient but spectral inefficient

The frequency of the carrier is always higher than the frequency of the signal

Square waves have harmonics which results in multiple sidebands  
Square waves are only odd harmonics

Distortion results in even and odd harmonics

### Modulation
```
Frequency modulation
Amplitude modulation
Phase modulation
```

In the analogue domain, phase modulation and frequency modulation look the same

In the digital domain, we can distinguish all forms of modulation

### Multiplying
```
log(n) + log(p) = n * p
```

### Modulation Efficiency
```
Pt = Total power
Pc = Power of carrier
m = Modulation

Pt = Pc * (1+(m^2/2))
```
