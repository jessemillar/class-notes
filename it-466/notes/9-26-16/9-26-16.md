### General Notes
- Solid state drives have longevity measured in read/write cycles
- Solid state drives are divided into logical cells
- The operating system moves data around to use cells evenly to prolong the life of the drive (this is called write leveling)
- This causes problems when you're trying to wipe an SSD

Enterprise versions of Windows have a program called `gpedit.msc` that allows you to easily change settings through group policies

LANMAN takes a password and...

- Makes it uppercase
- Crops it to 14 characters
- Splits into two, seven-byte blocks
- Encrypts the two byte blocks using DES (twenty year old encryption standard)
