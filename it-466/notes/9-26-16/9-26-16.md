### General Notes
- Solid state drives have longevity measured in read/write cycles
- Solid state drives are divided into logical cells
- The operating system moves data around to use cells evenly to prolong the life of the drive (this is called write leveling)
- This causes problems when you're trying to wipe an SSD
