### General Notes
Attempting to prevent giant problems from zero-day exploits, a number of large companies utilize two back-to-back firewalls from different vendors so if one is exploited the other will be fine

### Packet Filtering Firewall Rules
> Also referred to as "first gen" firewalls

- Extremely fast
- Can be complex
- No client configuration required
- Operates on the first 3 layers of the OSI model (won't protect against application-specific vulnerabilities)
- Uses ACLs (Access Control Lists)

### Stateful Firewalls
> Also known as "circuit level" firewalls; not the same as circuit level proxy firewalls

- Keeps a state table of all the connections going through

### Proxy Firewalls
> Meet my proxy, he will be our middleman

- No direct connection between endpoints
- True packet source is hidden to external world
- Can be limited in application support
- Degrades performance
- Can be bad for functionality due to breaking the chain of communication

### Application Layer Firewalls
- Has full knowledge of protocol that is being protected
  - Can distinguish between FTP GET and FTP PUT

### Private IP Ranges
|RFC1918 name|IP address range|number of addresses|
|---|---|---|
|24-bit block|10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255|16,777,216|
|20-bit block|172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255|1,048,576|
|16-bit block|192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255|65,536|
