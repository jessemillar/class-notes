### General Notes
- Complexity is the enemy of security
	- More complex systems are harder to monitor and protect
- Benefits of security frameworks
	- Standardized methodology
	- Verifiable
	- Basis for comparison
	- Meaningful
	- Everyone is speaking the same language
- Some companies mandate that employees take a 10 day break so someone else can do their job and potentially discover things that are going wrong (like embezzling of funds)
