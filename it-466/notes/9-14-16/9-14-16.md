### Definitions
- `Due Care` The conduct a reasonable person would exercise in a particular situation
- `Due Diligence` The process of gathering facts to make an informed choice on a matter
- `Circumstantial Evidence` Evidence that tries to increase the potency of other evidence
- `Corroborative` Used to build a case (lowest form of allowed evidence in court)

### General Notes
The difference between "due care" and "due diligence" will probably come up on the exam

Anything a computer does or records is "hearsay evidence" unless it's something recorded by a normal, standardized, best practice piece of code

It's accepted best practice to take an MD5 hash of data, but don't rely just on it

SHA256 is the minimum acceptable hash

A patent protects an invention and a copyright protects the right to recreate
