## Definitions
- `Market subsidy` A payment from the government to firms for producing or to comsumers for purchasing a particular commodity
	- Food stamps are a subsidy provided directly to consumers

## General Notes
- Market distortions alter otherwise efficient market outcomes
- Common causes of market distortions:
	1. Commodity taxes
		- Ad valorem
			- Percentage
		- Specific commodity
			- Fixed dollar
	1. Market subsidies
	1. Price ceilings
	1. Price floors
	1. Restrictions on entry or exit
	1. Prohibited markets
	1. Tariffs and quotas
- In some situations where the market is not finding efficient equilibriums on its own, public policies can actually push toward efficiency
	- In the chapter, we assume that the market outcome will be efficient if the government didn't become involved
- Government tax revenue is `t x Q` (tax times quantity)
- A "deadweight burden" is a measure of the market inefficiency created by a tax
	- The deadweight burden is caused by the change in market price that is the result of imposing a tax
- Government does not get to decide who pays the tax in the end
	- E.g. Firms will offset the amount they pay as a tax onto the consumer
- "The more inelastic the supply, the more the burden of a tax falls on suppliers"
	- Vice versa applies too
- "An excise tax collected from suppliers will increase the market price. An excise tax collected from demanders will decrease the market price."
- A caution: Taxes imposed on a single market almost always affect many different markets (although we focus only on the effects in a single market)
