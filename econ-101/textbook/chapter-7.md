## General Notes
- "The essence of demand is substitution"
	- "Because we substitute, behavior is predictable"
	- A demand curve is a picture of substitution
- Measuring the elasticity of demand is a way of measuring how substitutable one good is for other goods that individuals consume
- The more narrowly defined the product, the more elastic the demand
	- This is because a narrowly-defined product is easily substitutable
- See Figure 1 on page 92 of the textbook for a rudimentary visualization of elasticity
	- Remember the rubber band analogy
		- If a rubber band stretches a lot when you pull on it, you'd call it elastic
			- You'd call it inelastic if it didn't stretch very much
- Elastic markets change demand drastically in response to price changes
	- If a price is lowered, an elastic market would increase demand
- Price elasticity of demand
	- `e = percentage change in quantity demanded/percentage change in price`
	- Also known as "own-price elasticity" of demand or the "elasticity of demand"
- Demand is elastic if the absolute value of the measured elasticity is greater than 1
	- Demand is inelastic is the absolute value of the measured elasticity is less than 1
- There are different estimates for elasticity on demand based on the information available:
	1. Arc elasticity estimate
		- Requires information on two price-quantity combinations
	1. Point elasticity estimate
		- Requires information on one price-quantity combination and the slope of the demand curve
	1. Total expenditure estimate
		- Requires information on changes in total expenditures and the direction of a price change
	1. Degree of substitution estimate
		- Requires information on the range of substitues
- Elasticity is not equivalent to slope although it is related to the slope
- When demand is inelastic, a decrease in price also leads to a decrease in total expenditures
- When demand is elastic, good substitutes exist and are available
- On a unitary elastic demand curve, every point has an elasticity of demand equal to 1
	- This type of curve is called a "rectangular hyperbola" because a rectangle inscribed anywhere below the curve will always have the same area
	- See Figure 9 on page 99 of the text for an example
- Because farm products are inelastic, the demand for most farm products are also income inelastic
	- Over long periods of time, the relative size of the farm sector declines which means there are less people employed as farmers
- A **change in demand** is a shift in the demand curve (caused by things like new technology, something causing cancer, etc.)
- A **change in quantity demanded** is a movement along the existing demand curve (caused by a change in price)

## Second Law of Demand
- "The price elasticity of demand will increase with time"

## Arc Elasticity Estimate
- Obtains an estimate of the percentage change in quantity and the percentage change in price
```
                 (q2-q1)/(q2+q1)/2
arc elasticity = -----------------
                 (p2-p1)/(p2+p1)/2
```

## Point Elasticity Estimate
- Useful if we know the slope of the demand curve
```
elasticity = p/q * 1/slope
```

## Total Expenditures Estimate
- Total expenditure and hence, total revenue, will be equal to the amount sold multiplied by the market price
```
TE = TR = p * Q
```

## Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
- A positive cross-price elasticity indicates that two commodities are substitutes
- A negative cross-price elasticity indicates that two commodities are complements
```
    percentage change in the quantity of A demanded
e = -----------------------------------------------
        percentage change in the price of B
```

## Income Elasticity of Demand
```
    percentage change in quantity demanded
e = --------------------------------------
         percentage change in income
```

|Income elasticity of demand|Commodity description|
|---|---|
|e > 1|The commodity is a normal good and a luxury item|
|0 < e < 1|The commodity is a normal good|
|e < 0| The commodity is an inferior good|
