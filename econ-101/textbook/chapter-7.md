## General Notes
- "The essence of demand is substitution"
	- "Because we substitute, behavior is predictable"
- See Figure 1 on page 92 of the textbook for a rudimentary visualization of elasticity
	- Remember the rubber band analogy
		- If a rubber band stretches a lot when you pull on it, you'd call it elastic
			- You'd call it inelastic if it didn't stretch very much
- Elastic markets change demand drastically in response to price changes
	- If a price is lowered, an elastic market would increase demand
- Price elasticity of demand
	- `e = percentage change in quantity demanded/percentage change in price`
	- Also known as "own-price elasticity" of demand or the "elasticity of demand"
- Demand is elastic if the absolute value of the measured elasticity is greater than 1
	- Demand is inelastic is the absolute value of the measured elasticity is less than 1
- There are different estimates for elasticity on demand based on the information available:
	1. Arc elasticity estimate
		- Requires information on two price-quantity combinations
	1. Point elasticity estimate
		- Requires information on one price-quantity combination and the slope of the demand curve
	1. Total expenditure estimate
		- Requires information on changes in total expenditures and the direction of a price change
	1. Degree of substitution estimate
		- Requires information on the range of substitues

## Arc Elasticity Estimate
- Obtains an estimate of the percentage change in quantity and the percentage change in price
```
                 (q2-q1)/(q2+q1)/2
arc elasticity = -----------------
                 (p2-p1)/(p2+p1)/2
```
