## General Notes
- We assume that individuals are rational and work to maximize their well-being
- Types of choices:
	1. Traditional (my father did this)
	1. Random
	1. Rational
		- Make informed comparisons between the options they might choose
		- Are consistent in their comparisons of options they might choose
		- Choose the options they prefer
- "Comparability is at the heart of rational behavior"
- Consistency
	- I like A more than B and B more than C so I like A more than C
- Assuming that individuals can make comparisons implies that they are informed about the options that might be chosen
- Individuals making informed decisions have "rational expectations"
- "Economics presumes that, in most cases, individuals are in the best position to choose and ought to be free to do so"
- Diminishing marginal returns
	- "As the amount of one item used or consumed increases relative to the amount of other items that can e used or consumed, the incremental or marginal value of that item, at some point, will begin to decrease"
	- Too much of a good thing...
	- "Marginal" refers to the last unit, or the additional unit, or each subsequent unit"
		- Marginal satisfaction is the amount of satisfaction or gain obtaines through the addition of a good (E.g. Eating one more ice cream cone)
	- "To find those situations when diminishing marginal returns will be important, look for one element that is unchanging or fixed (such as amount of time in a day or number of workers) against which an individual makes choices"
- In analyzing marginal benefits, it is helpful (and normal) to assign dollar values to satisfaction levels
- In the tennis table below, marginal satisfaction is calculated by taking the change in total satisfaction divided by the change in the number of sets played
- Marginal cost must be factored in when looking for the optimal satisfaction increase
	- When marginal cost is factored in, optimal level of play is when the marginal satisfaction is equal to the marginal cost incurred (see tables in textbook around page 53)
- "Individuals seeking the optimal or best decision will ignore costs that cannot be affected by the decision. Put simply, 'sunk' costs are irrelevant where sunk costs are any unrecoverable expenditure made in the past."
	- See tables on page 55 of the text for an analysis of the irrelevance of sunken costs
	- "Sunk costs do not affect marginal costs and, therefore, cannot affect the optimal decision"
	- Water under the bridge; don't cry over spilt milk
- Equi marginal principle
	- "When there are many things that can be chosen, the best mix is obtained when the marginal benefit per additional dollar cost is the same for all things consumed or all activity levels chosen"
