## General Notes
- From a demander's perspective, the market price is the marginal cost of consuming an additional unit of a particular commodity
- Individuals substitute relatively inexpensive things for relatively expensive things as prices change
	- If your rent doubles and your income does not change, choosing to stay in the apartment will mandate less consumption of other goods because of lack of funds
- The individual's demand schedule can be thought of in two ways:
	1. It is the quantity an individual wishes to purchase at each price
	1. It is the amount of money that an individual is willing to pay for a small additional amount at each level of consumption
- The market demand is the sum of the quantity that all demanders wish to purchase at each price
- The First Law of Demand is the inverse relationship between the market price and the quantity that participants in a market wish to purchase
	- This relationship occurs for two reasons:
		1. For each individual currently in the market there is generally an inverse relationship between the market price and desired consumption
		1. As the market price decreases, additional demanders enter the market and, as the market price increases, demanders leave the market
- Market demand is the sum of the quantities that demanders individually wish to purchase when each must pay the same market price
- When market prices increase, commodities are rationed to those willing to pay more, and those willing to pay less leave the market
- Commodities that go together (CDs and CD players) are complements
- Commodities that can be interchanged are called substitutes
- If the demand for a good increases when individual incomes increase, the good is a "normal commodity"
- If the demand for a good decreases when individual incomes increase, the good is an "inferior commodity"
- Adding more people to the population results in more market demand
- "It is reliance on relative prices as the important element in explaining behavior that characterizes the economic approach to problems"
- "If A is a normal commodity, the income effect will push in the same direction as the substitution effect of the relative price change"
	- The income effect is the result of a change in income for yourself or a household
- See page 90 in the textbook for a useful chart of effects on demand
