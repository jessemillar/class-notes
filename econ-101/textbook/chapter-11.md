## General Notes
- "As long as the US economy differs from other economies, the US will always have a comparative advantage in some area"
- If the world price of a good drops, people will buy more traded goods
	- If the world price rises, people will buy more domestically-produced goods
	- See supply and demand graphs around page 173 in the textbook
- Exports from the US must be equal to imports for one or more other countries
- If the world price of a good is above the domestic price of a good, domestic producers are incentivised to export said good
- World trade benefits consumers and can harm domestic producers
- World trade allows economies to consume outside of their PPF
- Foreign exchange markets exist to exchange one currency for another (E.g. US dollar for Euro)
	- A change in the exchange rate is called either `appreciation` or `depreciation`
- Supply and demand of a currency determines it's value/exchange rate
- Appreciation or depreciation of a currency in foreign exchange markets does not necessarily affect the purchasing power of the money withing an economy
	- Appreciation and depreciation should not be confused with inflation and deflation
- Because we use money to trade with other nations as opposed to trading goods for goods, we run the risk of creating trade imbalance
	- Generally, a nation cannot survive an extended trade imbalance
	- A trade surplus is when a country exports more than it imports
	- A trade deficit is when a country imports more than it exports
- A US trade deficit leads to:
	1. Accumulation of dollars by foreigners
	1. Increase in supply of dollars on foreign exchange markets
	1. Depreciation of the dollar
	1. Decrease in the price of US goods to foreigners and an increase in the price of foreign goods to the US
	1. Increase in US exports and a decrease in US imports
	1. Elimination or reduction of the trade deficit
- A US trade surplus leads to:
	1. Accumulation of foreign currency held by US citizens
	1. Decrease in supply of dollars on foreign exchange markets
	1. Appreciation of the dollar
	1. Increase in the price of US goods to foreigners and a decrease in the price of foreign goods in the US
	1. Decrease in US exports and an increase in US imports
	1. Reduction or elimination of the trade surplus
- Countries sometimes manipulate their currency values in foreign markets in order to sustain either a trade deficit or surplus
