## Terms
- `Leisure`
- `Work`	
- `Scarcity`
- `Capital` Anything produced that is used to produce other things; E.g. Tools, human skills, etc.
- `Investment`
- `Production possibilities frontier (PPF)` The boundary between the output mises that can be produced and those that, given scarce resources and available technologies, cannot; E.g. With ten hours of work a day you can only harvest so many coconuts and palm leaves
- `Logical model` An abstract way of looking at a complex situation
- `Competition`
- `Spontanous order`
- `Invisible hand` Unintentional benefits in an exchange; E.g. Both parties come away in a better state than they entered
- `Relative production costs` The amount of one commodity that must be given up to produce an amount of another commodity
- `Exchange ratio`

## General Notes
- Scarcity forces us to make choices
- When you make a choice, that choice "costs" whatever you did not choose
- One aspect of economics is allowing individuals to consume different bundles of commodities than they produce
- Specialization is determined by differences in relative production costs
