## Definitions
- `Positive analysis` Predicting responses to incentives and describing how markets work
- `Normative analysis` Evaluating market outcomes as consistent or inconsistent with what should be
- `Arbitrage` Direct cross-market linkages caused by specializing in moving commodities between markets in response to profitable differences in prices and rates of return

## General Notes
- Four ways markets can be considered efficient:
	1. Adjustment efficiency
		- Price changes and profit-induced capital movements accomodating changes in the economy rapidly
	1. Informational efficiency
		- Gathering and transmitting information necessary to make appropriate allocations andadjustments rapidly
	1. Dynamic efficiency
		- Stimulating technological development to a greater degree
	1. Allocative efficiency
		- Efficient allocation of resources
- "In efficient markets, all consumers pay the same price"
- "At the margin, the cost of producing an additional unit of output is the same for all firms producing a particular commodity as long as all firms face the same market price"
- "In a competitive market, the price that consumers pay is the same as the price that the firms receive"
- Marginal rate of substitution in consumption:
	MS(A)/MS(B) = p(A)/p(B)
- Marginal rate of transformation in production:
	p(A)/p(B) = MC(A)/MC(B)
- Consumer surplus is the amount of money that an individual would have been willing to pay above the price they actually paid 
	- E.g. Buying a TV for $250 when the consumer was willing to pay $400 would result in a consumer surplus of $150
