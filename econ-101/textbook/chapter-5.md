## General Notes
- A market is a set of related transactions for a particular thing
	- Does not have to be a physical market
- Products can be one of two things
	1. Goods
	1. Services
- Markets for commodities that are used to produce goods or services are referred to as resource or input markets
- At higher prices, suppliers are willing to supply more of a good
	- Charts of this price/amount relationship are called "supply schedules"
	- Supply schedules and supply charts are always referencing a period of time (like a month or year)
- At higher prices, demanders are willing to buy less of a good
	- This is shown in a "demand schedule"
- The First Law of Demand is that there is an inverse relationship between the relative price of a commodity and the quantity demanded
- The difference between how many of a good suppliers would like to sell at a price vs how many demanders are willing to buy at a price is called "excess supply"
	- Excess demand is the inverse problem
- When there is excess supply, there is an incentive to lower prices in order to sell
	- "If the market price is free to decrease when there is excess supply, the excess supply will be eliminated by market forces"
		- And vice versa
- When supply and demand match, the market is in "equilibrium"
- A decrease in supply will lead to a higher equilibrium market price, with less of the commodity being both bought and sold in the market
- A decrease in demand, if nothing else changes, will lead to a lower equilibrium market price with less of the commodity being both bought and sold
- An increase in supply will lead to a lower equilibrium market price with more of the commodity being both bought and sold
