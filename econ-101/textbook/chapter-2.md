## Terminology
- `Aggregate PPF` A PPF graph representing efficient production for an entire economy (the line is dependent on the allocation of work for each individual worker)
- `Comparative advantage`
- `Relative price` A $24 shirt is worth 12 pounds of oranges (if the price were $2/pound)
- `Distribution of individual income`
- `Aggregate saving` The difference between what an economy can produce and what is actually consumed by those living within it

## General Notes
- The economy is spontaneously organized, without the direction of anyone, in response to a particular relative price and the incentives it provides
- When relative prices change, the distribution of (individual) income also changes
- When relative prices change, the distribution of jobs across an economy also changes and some individuals will have to move from one job to another
- All of the important elements of choice are decentralized (each individual makes their own choice and the social choice is just the sum of these choices)
	- Decisions made purposefully by a group of people (a committee) are called "centralized choices"
