## General Notes
- Domestication of grains first occurred in the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (between 4000 and 3500 B.C.)
- Creative development is the key to the beginning of civilization
- Babylonians developed a unique numbering system based on the number 60

## Mesopotamia
- Means "between the rivers" (because it was between the fertile Tigris and Euphrates rivers)
- The Tigris and Euphrates rivers are full of beneficial silt, but the timing of the annual flooding of these rivers does not coincide with the growing season
	- Dams and catch basins were created to partially solve this problem
	- Over time, the salt buildup caused crops to not grow; to solve this:
		- The civilization could move
		- The soil could be flushed with water

### Sumerians
- The first group to control Mesopotamia (3500 B.C. to 2350 B.C.)
- Polytheistic faith
	- Gods were associated with nearly everything in the environment
		- Keep the gods happy, live a happy life
	- Priests assisted in sacrifices but answered to the king
- Large cities enclosed within rectangular walls
- Were the first to develop wheeled vehicles

#### Cuneiform
- Means "wedge writing"
- Sumerian written language
- Began as pictograms
	- Pictograms did not always look the same (a picture of wheat drawn by one person was not the same as that drawn by another person)
- Later developed into ideograms
	- Ideograms look the same when drawn by different people
- Written on soft clay tablets

#### Ziggurats
- Pyramid-like religious buildings
- Built of dried mud bricks
- Solid brass gates
- Served as temples, tombs, and government sites
- The tower of Babel was potentially a ziggurat

### Akkadian Conquerors
- Also called "Semitic" people
- The second group of people to inhabit Mesopotamia (2350 B.C. to 1650 B.C.)
- One of the world's oldest known literary documents is the Akkadian poem "The Epic of Gilgamesh" (written in about 2000 B.C.)

#### Sargon I
- The first Akkadian king
- Created the first standing army
	- Constantly fought to be paid via the spoils of war

#### Hammurabi
- The great Babylonian king (around 1750 B.C.)
- Set up a governmental bureaucracy to oversee remote parts of the kingdom

## The Code of Hammurabi
- Written in Akkadian on basalt rock stele (a pillar)
- A written code of law
- Reduced resentment of subjugated people and the possibility of revolt
- Similar to the Mosaic Law
	- Mosaic Law was given by God where the Hammurabi Code was man-created
- Established a trial system where the accuser was punished if the accusation couldn't be proved
- Differing punishment levels for differing social classes

## Hittites
- Came into power around 1650 B.C.
- From Anatolia (present-day Turkey)
- Figured out how to smelt and form iron
	- Ushered in the iron age
	- Improved both warfare and agriculture
	- Iron requires higher temperatures which are achieved by burning wood to coal and then burning the coal while blowing air over it

## Phoenicians/Philistines/Sea Peoples
- Conquered the Hittites and learned to make iron from them
- Rose to power around 1200 B.C.
- Were largely traders
- Invented the alphabet
	- Didn't write the vowels
- Made dye for royal purple

- Good with ship and building construction

## Israelites
- Rose to power under Saul, David, and Solomon during the time of the Phoenicians
- Israel nations were usually under the control of a larger Mesopotamian empire
- Major empires fought over Israelite land because trade routes passed through Hebrew territory

## Assyrians
- Warlike people
- Rose to power in 900 B.C.
- Capital city was Ninevah
- Often carried off the conquered people to replace them with people they trusted

## Later Babylonians, Medes and Persians
- Around 700 B.C. the Chaldeans conquered Mesopotamia
- The Chaldeans were shortly conquered by the Medes
- The Medes then merged with the Persians
- Kings of this period (Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus the Great, Xerxes and Darius) were extremely powerful
	- Instituted king worship
- Made the Hanging Gardens and other world wonders
- Adept at star measurement and prediction
- Developed the zodiac
- Conquered in 333 B.C. by Alexander the Great
