## General Notes
- By the end of the Golden Age, the Greeks had largely abandoned belief in the gods of Olympus 
	- Some offerings still occurred
	- Left the Greeks in need of normal ethical standards
	- Philosophy filled this gap

## Descent of Ethical Systems from Plato
1. Plato
1. Skeptics/Cynics
1. Stoics
1. Christians

### Plato
- Described the perfect society in his book "The Republic"
- Rejected sensory information
	- Platonists could not accept knowledge known only through the senses
	- Could not know anything for sure and suspended knowing for sure until an absolute knowledge could be acquired which never came
		- This philosophy is called Skepticism or Cynicism

#### Stoics
- A modification of the Skeptic philosophy
- Began at a school founded in Athens by Zenos
- Accepted Plato's rejection of the senses but did not totally reject the value of experience
- Practice of this belief is called asceticism
- Stoics lived simple lives and attempted to grow close to and understand the "ultimate truth"
- Attempted to find this truth through pure reason
- Believed the Divine Will (Logos) permeated all being and all parts of nature
	- Believed the Divine Will controlled all the events of the world
	- Some Stoics saw the Divine Will as a god and others saw it as a force (like Mother Nature)
- Had a profound impact on Christian thinking
- Was similar to Roman thinking so lots of Romans adopted Stoical thinking
	- Romans believed strongly in family, freedom (for themselves), rational and participative government, loyalty, perseverance, bravery, and self-sacrifice for the greater good of the society
- The Divine Will (Logos) can be equated to The Force in Star Wars
	- Jedi exhibit attributes associated with Stoics such as unemotional behavior, deep concentration, belief in the rationality and consistency of Nature and a confidence in an ultimate good

#### Diogenes
- A leader of the Skeptics
- Was visited by Alexander the Great
	- Diogenes was sunbathing during the visit and didn't acknowledge Alexander's presence
	- Alexander offered whatever Diogenes wanted
		- Diogenes requested that Alexander move out of the sunlight

### Aristotle
- Aristotelians were sometimes called Peripatetics
	- Means "those who wander around" because they wandered the world seeking knowledge
	- Focused on the development of an ethics system

#### Epicurus
- Lived in Athens between 340 B.C. and 270 B.C.
- Wrote over 300 treatises defining an ethical system
- Followers were called Epicureans
	- Felt strongly that gaining knowledge through the senses and adding emotions were valid interpretation methods
	- Sought out and promoted emotions
	- Believed that happiness flowed to those who were right or ethical
