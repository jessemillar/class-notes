## General Notes
- Changes in Christianity after Christ's death:
	1. Geography

	1. Sociology
		- From a mostly rural to a mostly urban movement
	1. Language
		- From Aramaic (spoken by Christ) to Greek
	1. Culture
		- From Jewish to Greco-Roman
- Problems for the Early Church:
	1. Persecution from the Jews
	1. No reference text on which to base Christian teaching
		- New Testament assembled in 5th Century
		- Letters of Paul came first then the Gospels
	1. Disagreements among the leaders of the Church
- Many creative individuals have expressed their feelings on Christianity
	- Handel's *Messiah*
	- Milton's *Paradise Lost*
- The Jewish court (the Sanhedrin) found Christ guilty and took him before the Romans
- Jewish leaders viewed Christianity as an "aberrant version of Judaism" and felt threatened by Christianity's message and its warm reception
	- Many Jews tried to dissuade or kill Christian leaders
- Nero really didn't like Christians
	- Once crucified them and burned them along the Appian Way (the main thoroughfare into Rome) to provide lighting for the road
- Romans destroyed Jerusalem and scattered the Jews
	- This caused a change in the Christian religion
	- Center of the church moved from Jerusalem to Antioch
- One of the first problems the early Christians faced was leadership succession
	- We know this from the Christian bishop of Caesarea's historical account entitled Eusebius
- A second problem was propagated doctrinal error
	- When the Gentile converts hit a doctrinal dilemma, they turned to their previous faith to solve the issue
- Logos (the Greek idea of a guiding force or power) was an important idea to Christians
- Dominant doctrinal positions were known as orthodox
- Conflicting views were known as heretical
- In the third century, local election of bishops by a council of local elders (called presbyters) was widespread throughout the Christian church
	- A hierarchy of bishops naturally developed
	- Higher bishops eventually became known as archbishops and cardinals or metropolitans
- Early Christian hermits that gathered around the shores of the Red Sea competed with each other for greater displays of self-sacrifice
	- Rules were eventually set up to reign in the hermits
	- Rules were called the Christian monastic orders
		- Created by St. Anthony in Egypt (about 305 A.C.)
- In the fourth century, Christians rose to about 10 percent of the Roman population
- Around this time, some Christians fled the Roman Empire and lived among the barbarians
	- This led to the conversion of many of the barbarians
- Persecution of the Christians ended when Constantine issued his edict of religious tolerance
- Arian Christianity decreed that Christ was only a mortal man begotten of God and reduced his role to the lesser status of a demigod
	- This doctrine was popular among Egyptian Christians
- The Nicene Council resolved some of the doctrinal issues plaguing the Christian Church
	- Reached an agreement on the nature of the Trinity
	- Contributed to the eventual split between Christian Churches along the east/west border of the Roman empire 
- In the sixth century, Pope Gregory I tried to entice pagan's to join the Christian church

## The Second Century
