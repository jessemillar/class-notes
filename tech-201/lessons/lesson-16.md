	- Calendar from the Egyptians
- Roman art is so similar to Greek art that it is considered Greek art
	- Roman artists were praised for how closely they could copy Greek styles
- Greeks were constantly striving for fundamental truths and Forms which led to instability at time because their goals were so abstract
	- Romans strove for more concrete ideals
- Virgil modeled his epic poem, The Aeneid, on Homer's classics
	- Aeneas is a more moderate character than Odysseus
	- The Odyssey laid out ethics for the Greeks and the Aeneid reflected current Roman values
- "Is the adoption and adaptation of another culture's ideas creative in itself, or is just the genesis of these ideas by the original culture a creative process?"
- Romans liked to decorate tombs and memorials with sculpture, often done in relief
