	- Took the arch from the Etruscans
	- Ships from the Carthaginians
	- Calendar from the Egyptians
- Roman art is so similar to Greek art that it is considered Greek art
	- Roman artists were praised for how closely they could copy Greek styles
- Greeks were constantly striving for fundamental truths and Forms which led to instability at time because their goals were so abstract
	- Romans strove for more concrete ideals
- Virgil modeled his epic poem, The Aeneid, on Homer's classics
	- Aeneas is a more moderate character than Odysseus
	- The Odyssey laid out ethics for the Greeks and the Aeneid reflected current Roman values
- "Is the adoption and adaptation of another culture's ideas creative in itself, or is just the genesis of these ideas by the original culture a creative process?"
- Romans liked to decorate tombs and memorials with sculpture, often done in relief
	- See the Arch of Titus
- Romans developed (or stole) concrete and perfected the arch

- The Coliseum in Rome had numbered seats like a modern sports stadium
- The Roman Pantheon had a large dome 140 ft in diameter
	- Lit by a single opening in the top called an oculus
- Roman roads were so well built that some are still used today
	- The Appian Way is one such road
	- The ruts from wheels were cut into the roads over time
		- Wagons eventually were built to fit the ruts
		- Trains were made to fit this width too
- Different societies focused on different things:
	1. Egyptians and Mesopotamians: What is out there?
	1. Greeks: Why does it exist?
	1. Romans: What is it good for?
- Caesar wanted to be as much of a conqueror as Alexander the Great
