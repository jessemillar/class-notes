## Aristotle
### Physics
- It is reasonable to think that stars are spherical
	- Spherical objects can spin or roll
- The visual ray of a star becoming "excessively prolonged becomes weak and wavering"
- Apparently thought the moon was a star because he reasoned that stars "certainly do not roll" because the one face of the moon is always visible
- Noted that certain stars are visible in certain places (like Egypt) and not in other places (like the northern hemisphere)
	- Used this point to reason that the earth is a sphere

### Poetics
- Discussed what makes a good poem/story
	1. "What is the poet to aim at, and what is he to avoid, in constructing his Plots?"
	1. "What are the conditions on which the tragic effect depends?"
- A good tragedy must have a complex plot
	- Must also cause fear and pity in the audience
- There are three plot forms that should be avoided:
	1. A good man must not be seen passing from happiness to misery
	1. A bad man must not pass from misery to happiness
	1. An extremely bad man should not be seen falling from happiness into misery
		- Aristotle claims this one is just boring
- A perfect plot must have a single issue
- The hero's fortunes must go from happiness to misery
	- The cause of this fall must come from some great error on the hero's part
- Necessary character traits:
	1. Characters shall be good
		- Good human beings that reveal moral purpose in word and deed
	1. Characters will be appropriate
		- "It is not appropriate in a female Character to be manly, or clever"
	1. Make characters "like the reality"
	1. Make characters consistent
- There should be nothing improbable among the actual incidents of the play
