- Minos' daughter, Ariadne spun silk thread to help Theseus (son of the king of Athens) kill the Minotaur and escape the labyrinth

#### Minoan Demise
- Society randomly and mysteriously disappeared around 1400 B.C.
- Historians do not know why but think it was maybe a volcano erupted nearby or the Greeks conquered
- A Greek numbering system error could have made the Minoan society Atlantis which was destroyed by volcano

### Mycenaeans
- Very important in Greek history (fought the Trojan War and interacted with the gods of Olympus)
- Culturally and politically dominated by Minoans in the early years of the culture
- Palaces were built with high walls because of the constant threat of attack
- Went to war with Troy around 1200 B.C. over Helen who was kidnapped despite being married

### Dark Age of Greece
- Caused by Dorian invaders around 1000 B.C.
- Dark age of "culture and diminished creativity"
- City states resulted in smaller, local government but many more wars
	- City states helped with the rise of democracy

### Spartans

- Young boys ilved in the barracks until they were 20
- They were frontline soldiers until 30
- Sent home to be home guard after that
