### Syllabus
There are answers to even-numbered problems on the course website
The odd-numbered problems have their answers in the textbook

The professor didn't know of a legal way to obtain the textbook digitally

Open reading assignments:  
- Read a current, technical article (not about Shakespeare)
- Write a report on it
- Can be turned in ASAP

Quizzes can be made up
- For full-credit within the first week
- For 50% credit thereafter

The professor really doesn't like not turning in assignments  
Says he will have our "attitude" grade largely decided by how many 0% assignments we have

30 points (about 20%) of our professionalism grade are awarded in response to following the Honor Code  
5 points deducted for each infraction

### Upcoming Quiz
Memorize the resistor color code, the scientific prefixes, and the electronic terms

First quiz will have 51 questions in six minutes (all memorization)
Covers the part in green on the slides

`TODO: See [lecture slides](https://camtasiarelay.byu.edu/relay/cr/Inductance_and_Inductors_-_20140910_164905_7.html) for things to memorize`

### Definitions
- The flow of electrons is electricity
- Joules is a measure of energy
- Watts is a measure of rate (power/second)
- Make sure to use lowercase `f` for frequency (`F` will be used later on)
- `CPS` is the old unit for Hertz

### General Content
To understand digital, you have to start with analog  

Wireless, optical fiber, and copper wire are the options for getting data from point A to point B

Resistors, capacitors, and inductors are all involved in "a copper wire"
- Resistors are a zig-zag in diagrams
