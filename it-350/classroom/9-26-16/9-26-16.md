### General Notes

### Normal Forms
#### First Normal Form
#### Second Normal Form
> Only worry about 2NF when the key is composite (uses more than one key to uniquely identify)

#### Third Normal Form
For all FD's X -> A X is a superkey or A is a member of a candidate key

#### Boyce-Codd Normal Form
For all non-trivial FD's, X -> A, X is a superkey

> Sometimes you will not be able to represent all dependencies
