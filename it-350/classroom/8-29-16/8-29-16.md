### General Notes
- Lectures on Monday for two hours and then just labs on Wednesdays  
- Lectures will happen on the first three days (Monday, Wednesday, and the following Wednesday [no class on Labor Day])
- The last third of this class is a big project we do in teams of two

- There is a midterm and a final exam (both have a closed-book and a take-home portion)
- We don't need "Access" with the textbook, just the book "to read"
