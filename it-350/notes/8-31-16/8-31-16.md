### General Notes
- ER models are often referred to as "conceptual models"
- We should have a really good idea of what a data model is by the time we take the first exam
- We'll spend most of our time discussing the logical schema

### Definitions
- **Synonyms** Schema, metadata, data dictionary, system catalog, intension of the database
- **DDL** Data Definition Language (deals with the metadata of the database)
- **DML** Data Manipulation Language (extension or data of the database)
- **Conceptual Model** A not-too-detailed overview of an idea
- **Syntactic Model** A model that is technically correct but potentially has no semantic meaning
- **Semantic** The meaning behind something
- **Domain** A defined set of allowable values or entities
- **Candidate Key** A superkey such that no proper subset of its attributes is itself a superkey

### Data Viewing Levels
1. External Level (how people view the database)
1. Logical Level (the schema)
1. Internal Level (how we put stuff on disk and keep it from being erased or forgotten)

### ER Diagrams
- Relationships go in diamonds
- Entities go in rectangles
- Attributes go in circles
- Calculated attributes have a dashed outline

### Quotes
> The extension of the data is the data itself.
