### General Notes
The professors tries to write closed-book exam questions to test reading and comprehension (meant to see if you're reading and picking up concepts not covered in class)

There are currently 32 questions on the exam; almost all are fill-in-the-blank and short answer questions (he plans to modify between now and Wednesday)

Largely a vocabulary test

Normalization portions are on the open-book portion

Bold terms in the book will direct us

### Exam Hints
#### Reread the Following Topics
- Roles of users and managers of databases (DBAs, database architect, application programmers, etc.) [chapter 1 or 2]
- The two parts of the SQL language (data definition and data manipulation)
- Basics of relational algebra (symbols and their names and what they do)
- Know about constraints (attribute level vs. other)
- Data models (JSON, XML, all the ones the book has mentioned, etc.)
- Types of databases (hierarchal, relational, document-oriented, object-relational, etc.)
