### Normalization Notes
- In defining a universal relation, all the keys are a composite key for the whole relation
- If you assume something, you should state it
- Give relations incrementing names as you go (universal relations is `R0`)
- Split the universal relation one at a time
- Do not just break out the functional dependencies and make tables from them, you'll miss things
- Being able to figure out functional dependencies from a story is pretty important

### Normalization Example
> In my universe...

#### Universal Relation
```
title, year, length, studioName, rating, starName, studioAddr, starAddr, starCity, goodTitle, filmType
```

#### Functional Dependencies
```
studioName -> studioAddr
title -> goodTitle
title, year -> length, filmType, rating, studioName, studioAddr
starName -> starAddr, starCity
```

#### Normalization Process
1. Determine functional dependencies
1. Apply transitive rule to functional dependencies
1. The first question is whether the universal relation is in 1NF (are there multi-valued attributes?)
1. Fix the problem by breaking into multiple "leaves"
1. Are the leaves in 2NF (are there any attributes determined by a subset of the key?)
1. Fix the problem by breaking into multiple "leaves"
1. Are we in 3NF (transitive functional dependency is not allowed)
1. Fix the problem by breaking into multiple "leaves"

```
[* is a key]

First Step:
R0:
*title, *year, *length, *studioName, *rating, *starName, *studioAddr, *starAddr, *starCity, *goodTitle, *filmType

Second Step:
R1:
*title, *year, length, filmType, rating, studioName, studioAddr

R2:
*title, *year, *starName, *starAddr, *starCity, *goodTitle

Third Step:
R3:
*starName, starCity, starAddr

R4:
*title, *year, *starName, *goodTitle

Fourth Step:
R5:
*title, goodTitle

R6:
*title, year, starName

Fifth Step:
R7:
*studioName, studioAddr

R8:
*title, *year, length, filmType, rating, studioName
```

### General Notes
The professors tries to write closed-book exam questions to test reading and comprehension (meant to see if you're reading and picking up concepts not covered in class)

There are currently 32 questions on the exam; almost all are fill-in-the-blank and short answer questions (he plans to modify between now and Wednesday)

Largely a vocabulary test

Normalization portions are on the open-book portion

Bold terms in the book will direct us

Will probably take fifteen or twenty minutes; you'll either know it or you won't

### Exam Hints
#### Reread the Following Topics
- Roles of users and managers of databases (DBAs, database architect, application programmers, etc.) [chapter 1 or 2]
- The two parts of the SQL language (data definition and data manipulation)
- Basics of relational algebra (symbols and their names and what they do)
- Know about constraints (attribute level vs. other)
- Data models (JSON, XML, all the ones the book has mentioned, etc.)
- Types of databases (hierarchal, relational, document-oriented, object-relational, etc.)
- Natural join
- Database level diagrams (predominately the three levels of database design and what the interface layers are between them)
